# Fuy.gg
Fuy.gg aims to be a successor and upgrade to AvoMod while being written with Artemis in mind.
This helps fix long-standing issues with AvoMod such as:
1. Reveal Nicknames
2. Stack Duplicate Messages
3. Commands such as /am find, pg, om, and ls being affected by the name change glitch

This probably wasn't needed, but I have been wanting to do this for a very long time, so I did it.

### Feature Requests
If you'd like to request any features either:
1. Message me on discord (@essentuan)
2. Create a pull request and maybe I'll accept

# DISCLAIMER
THIS CODEBASE HAS A LOT OF WEIRD SHIT I MADE AT 4AM DO NOT TELL ME THAT SOMETHING I DID IS SHIT BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW IT IS.  
Its also over-engineered but that's besides the point.
